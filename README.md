# 🛠 Versatile Heat Seat Press (MGN9 Based)

A mostly 3D-printed, modular heat-set press built to live on your desk — and do more than just press inserts.

This started as “I need a better way to install heat-set inserts.”  
It turned into a small, milling-machine-inspired vertical platform that can grow into whatever you want it to be.

Want a heat-set press? Done.  
Want a mini drill press with a Dremel? Go for it.  
Want a precision vertical driver for starting threads? Easy.

The whole thing is designed to be **modular, hackable, and expandable.**

✅ Ender 3 compatible (235mm x 235mm build volume)

# 🚧 Project Status

This is an **active, evolving project.**

New parts and refinements are being added as I iterate.  
Assembly documentation is still in progress — for now, the Fusion 360 file is the best reference for hardware placement.

If you build one or improve something, I’d genuinely love to see it.

# 📢 Latest Updates (2026-02-11)

- Added new fixture parts and accessory components  
- Added a **Blank Tool Mount** for custom tooling  
- Fixed base alignment issue (moved third bolt to rear to ensure perpendicular extrusion alignment)  
- Added **Mini Tombstones** (hold ~10 Canadian dimes — currently testing)

# 🎯 Features

## 🧱 Fixture Plate Base
25mm grid layout with M5 mounting points allows you to:
- Design custom jigs  
- Add hard stops  
- Mount angle plates  
- Create repeatable setups  

Built to be expanded — not just used once.

---

## 🚂 MGN9 Linear Rail
- 200mm MGN9 rail  
- MGN9H carriage  

Smooth, rigid, controlled vertical motion.

---

## ⚖ Adjustable Counterweight System
Stackable “Tombstones” let you tune the feel of the press.

Fill options:
- Canadian nickels (15 tested per tombstone)
- Canadian dimes (mini version)
- Lead tire weights
- Steel stock
- Sand (pause print before top layers)
- Any dense material that fits

Weight cavity size must be smaller than:

`30mm (L) x 10mm (W) x 10mm (H)`

## 🔧 Modular Tooling System

- Blank tool mount included  
- Design your own tool posts  
- Mount rotary tools  
- Create specialty press heads  
- Build custom driver holders  

If you can model it, you can mount it.

# 🧩 Print Notes

### Base
Large part — prone to warping.  
Ensure strong bed adhesion.

Optional: Manual filament swap at layer 3 for accent color.

### Tombstones
Use “Add Negative Part” in your slicer to create weight cavity.

Process:
1. Add cavity shape  
2. Add pause before bridge layer closes cavity  
3. Insert weights  
4. Resume print  

A Canadian nickel cavity model is included.

### Feet (x4)
Material: TPU  
- 2 walls  
- 3 bottom layers  
- 0 top layers  
- 25% hex infill  

### Tray (Optional)
Clips into extrusion.  
Convenient insert holder that stays out of the way.

# 💬 Final Notes

This press works great out of the box — but it was designed to grow with you.

Build it. Modify it. Improve it.
